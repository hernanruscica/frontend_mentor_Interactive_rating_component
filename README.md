## My process
  I started with the mobile layout first, keeping in mind the sizes of the requested viewports of the examples.
  I made two different pages for each component, this way I use less javascript and the code is neater, in pure HTML.
  It has some javascript for the functionality of sending the score to the "thanks" page. I use the localStorage to pass the selected score to the second page.
  For the css I use the BEM nomenclature and custom variables.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
